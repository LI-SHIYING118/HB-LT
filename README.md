Haplotype Block LSTM Hierarchical Transformer 
This is for the article "Leveraging hierarchical structures for genetic block interaction studies using the hierarchical transformer"
### Pre-analysis
Researchers are strongly suggested to perform covariant pre-filtering methods to limit potential confounding effects. A PCA-based pre-filtering method is provided and can be found in "covariants_filtering.py."
The current framework takes a unique data structure as input (see the example data file). We provided a script "haplotype block converting from VCF.py" to help researchers to convert their VCF files into files that can be processed by the current pipline.
